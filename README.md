# Expense-Tracker
My own expense tracker app in React Native 

This app is a test app for me to learn React Native. It is a simple expense tracker app that allows you to add expenses and see a list of all expenses.

## Installation
Clone this repo and run the following command to install all dependencies:
```
npm init

```
You may install the dependencies using sudo 


To start the server run the following command:

You can then scan the QR code with the Expo app on your phone to run the app on your phone.
Or use 'w' to open the app in your browser.
